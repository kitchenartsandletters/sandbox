      <h2>A Chef's Library with a Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        In partnership with Citymeals on Wheels, acclaimed chef Marc Forgione (chef-owner of Restaurant Marc Forgione,
        Peasant, and others, and a Food Network Iron Chef) has selected a set of chef- and restaurant-focused books and
        cookbooks integral to his perspective as a chef, storyteller, and food lover.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a limited time, these books are available in exclusive sets—offered with special keepsakes and a portion of
        proceeds supporting Citymeals’ mission to nourish homebound elderly New Yorkers with meal deliveries and companionship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re adding to your own cookbook library or looking for a meaningful gift, this is a unique opportunity to own
        books personally selected by one of New York’s most respected chefs—while making a real difference in the lives of others.

  <h2>Marc’s "Culinary Storytelling" Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>“I love hearing about people’s journeys through food,” says Marc Forgione.</strong></p>
  <p>
    That sentiment flows through his book selection. From Peter Hoffman’s ingredient-inspired reminiscences to Paul Bertolli’s culinary evolution to the daughter-father dynamic shared by Verveine Origner and Ken Oringer to the “idea essays” of Christian Puglisi to Matthew Weingarten and Raquel Pelzel’s paean to foraging and the ancient craft of preserving … all of Forgione’s selections will be as at home in an armchair as they are in the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p><strong>“These aren’t just cookbooks,” says Marc. “They’re storybooks as well.”</strong></p>
